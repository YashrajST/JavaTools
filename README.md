# JavaTools
This repository contains Java tools created to learn about the thought process of the creators of Java and to use it in future projects. The tools include:

* A setter-getter generator using the reflection API
* A keyboard class to avoid writing code to get input
* Replicas of classes like LinkedList and ArrayList

This repository can be used by developers to create and share Java tools with other developers. It can also be used by developers to learn about Java tools and how to use them.

**Why were these tools created?**

The creator of this repository wanted to learn about the thought process of the creators of Java and to use that knowledge to create useful tools for other developers. The creator also wanted to improve their development skills by creating and using these tools.

**How can these tools be used?**

The setter-getter generator can be used to automatically generate setter and getter methods for Java classes. This can save developers a lot of time and effort.

The keyboard class can be used to get input from the user without having to write any code. This can be useful for tasks such as reading user input from the console or getting input from a file.

The replicas of the LinkedList and ArrayList classes can be used to provide the same functionality as the original classes but with a different implementation. This can be useful for developers who want to understand how these data structures work internally or who want to create custom implementations.

**Who can benefit from this repository?**

This repository can be beneficial for developers of all experience levels. Experienced developers can use the tools to improve their productivity and to learn new things about Java. Beginner developers can use the tools to learn about Java tools and how to use them.
